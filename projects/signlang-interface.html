                        <p>This project began when my friend lost an arm and needed a more accessible way to communicate using sign language. I wanted to help them regain some independence, so I started building an interface that could translate one-handed inputs into digital gestures. I experimented with sensors, machine learning models, and lightweight interaction patterns to create something that felt natural. The project's purpose was personal, and every design choice came from trying to meet a real need.</p>
                        <p>This artifact shows how I approach engineering with empathy, careful attention, and direct communication with the person who will use the final product. I learned how to adapt tools to a single user's daily challenges, adjust design features based on comfort, and refine prototypes through consistent testing and feedback. It pushed me to think about accessibility not as a feature but as a core requirement. It strengthened my understanding of human-centered design and the responsibility engineers have when creating tools that affect someone's quality of life.</p>
                        <p>Including this artifact highlights that my motivation for building technology comes from people and not just technical curiosity. It reflects my desire to use engineering to support others in meaningful ways. It also reinforces that I value listening, patience, and thoughtful design. This project captures the kind of work I want to continue doing: work that matters to someone's life and reflects both technical effort and care.</p>
