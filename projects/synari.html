                        <p>Synari is a therapy practice management platform that I have been developing over the past year. I built it to help clinicians reduce the stress of documentation, scheduling, and administrative tasks that slow down their day. The project started after speaking with therapists who shared how inefficient their current tools were. I designed the entire system myself and shaped it through ongoing feedback from real users who needed something practical and reliable.</p>
                        <p>This artifact demonstrates my ability to build and maintain a full stack application from the ground up. Through Synari, I learned how to translate real user needs into technical decisions, create an interface that reduces cognitive load, and integrate AI responsibly within a workflow. It also reflects my experience managing a long-term project, gathering feedback, iterating on design choices, and building features through consistent testing. The work shows how I approach engineering through purpose, listening, and attention to detail.</p>
                        <p>Including Synari in my portfolio reveals that I care about building tools that have a real impact. It shows that I value persistence, empathy, and clear problem solving, and that I am capable of driving a project well beyond the scope of a class assignment. Synari reflects the engineer I am becoming: someone who builds intentionally, consults with users, and focuses on creating technology that eases people's lives.</p>
