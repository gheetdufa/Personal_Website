                        <p>Audit AI is a Chrome extension created to help users identify whether digital artwork is real or AI-generated. The idea came from seeing confusion and controversy surrounding the authenticity of online art. My team and I wanted to give everyday users a quick way to check the origins of what they were seeing. Audit AI analyzes images directly within the browser and provides an instant assessment, making it easier for people to navigate an online space where AI-generated content is becoming harder to distinguish.</p>
                        <p>This artifact shows a blend of skills across web development, machine learning, and user interface design. Building Audit AI required integrating a YOLO-based image recognition pipeline with a smooth frontend experience that fit naturally into the browser environment. The project challenged us to optimize performance, handle diverse image formats, and create a tool that felt fast and reliable. It demonstrates my ability to connect technical components into a cohesive product and to iterate on challenges such as latency, accuracy, and user experience. It also reflects my interest in transparency and digital literacy.</p>
                        <p>Including Audit AI shows my commitment to building tools that address current and emerging problems. It highlights my curiosity about how AI affects online spaces and my desire to give users more control over the content they encounter. This project reflects my ability to think critically about technology's impact, collaborate effectively, and turn an abstract concern into a functional solution. Audit AI represents the kind of builder I aim to be, someone who takes initiative and creates tools that give people clarity in a changing digital world.</p>
